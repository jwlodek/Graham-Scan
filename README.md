# Computational Geometry Algorithms

Algorithms implemented for my AMS 345 course at Stony Brook University

### Current implementations:

Graham Scan




### Unit testing

Unit tests for these algorithms are written with the help of the Criterion C/C++ unit testing library.

In order to install criterion for running tests, run the following:
```
git clone --recursive https://github.com/Snaipe/Criterion
cd Criterion
mkdir build
cd build
cmake ..
cmake --build .
sudo make install
```

Note that there are several dependencies that must be installed first.
